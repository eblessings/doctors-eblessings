Friendica on Github
===================

* [Home](help)

**Here is how you can work on the code with us**

1. Install git on the system you will be developing on.
2. Create your own [github](https://github.com) account.
3. Fork the Friendica repository from [https://github.com/friendica/friendica.git](https://github.com/friendica/friendica.git).
4. Clone your fork from your Github account to your machine.
Follow the instructions provided here: [http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) to create and use your own tracking fork on github
5. Commit your changes to your fork.
Then go to your github page and create a "Pull request" to notify us to merge your work.

**Branches**

There are two branches in the main repo on Github:

1. master: This branch contains stable releases only.
2. develop: This branch contains the latest code.
This is what you want to work with.

**Important**

Please pull in any changes from the project repository and merge them with your work **before** issuing a pull request.
We reserve the right to reject any patch which results in a large number of merge conflicts.
This is especially true in the case of language translations - where we may not be able to understand the subtle differences between conflicting versions.

Also - **test your changes**.
Don't assume that a simple fix won't break something else.
If possible get an experienced Friendica developer to review the code.
