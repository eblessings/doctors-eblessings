## Preparation

### Storage
Check your storage backend with ``bin/console storage list`` in the root folder.

If you are not currently using ``Database`` run the following commands:
1. ``bin/console storage set Database`` to active the database backend.
2. ``bin/console storage move`` to initiate moving the stored image files.

This process may take a long time depending on the size of your storage.
