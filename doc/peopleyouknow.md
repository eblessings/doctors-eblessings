This is the bit that makes Friendica unique.  You can connect to <i>anybody on the internet</i> from your Friendica account using this page!  The available connectors varies depending on which plugins you have installed, but for now, we'll walk you through Facebook.  If you need help with the rest, you can always ask at <a href = "http://helpers.pyxis.uberspace.de/profile/helpers">Friendica Support</a> or <a href = "https://kakste.com/help/Connectors" target="new">see the instructions here</a>.

The biggest of them all is Facebook.  Fortunately, this connector is really easy.  Scroll down the page, and click Facebook Connector Settings.  Enter your Facebook user name and password and let the application (the connector) do everything the options suggest.  You can <a href = "https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/How-to:-Friendica%E2%80%99s-Facebook-connector" target="new">fine tune this later</a>, but for now, we'll move on to <a href = "/help/makingnewfriends">making new friends</a>.
