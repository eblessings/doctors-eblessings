This is the bit that makes Friendica unique.  You can connect to <i>anybody on the internet</i> from your Friendica account using this page!  The available connectors varies depending on which plugins you have installed, but for now, we'll walk you through Facebook.  Note that not all servers have the Facebook connector installed.  If you can't find it in the list below, don't worry, we'll look at ways of connecting to more people in the following pages.  

The biggest of all social networks is Facebook.  Fortunately, this connector is really easy.  Scroll down the page, and click Facebook Connector Settings.  Enter your Facebook user name and password and let the application (the connector) do everything the options suggest.  You can <a href="https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/How-to:-Friendica%E2%80%99s-Facebook-connector" target="_blank">fine tune this</a> or experiment with the other connectors too.
