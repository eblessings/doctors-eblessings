/* This class is used to verify the homepage link of a user profile.
 * To do so, we look for rel="me" links in the given homepage, if one
 * of them points to the Friendica profile of the user, a verification
 * mark is added to the link.
 *
 * To reverse the process, if a homepage link is given, it is displayed
 * with the rel="me" attribute as well, so that 3rd party tools can
 * verify the connection between the two pages.
 *
 * This task will be performed by the worker on a daily basis _and_ every
 * time the user changes their homepage link. In the first case the priority
 * of the task is set to LOW, with the second case it is MEDIUM.
