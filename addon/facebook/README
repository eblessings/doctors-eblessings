Installing the Friendika/Facebook connector

1. register an API key for your site from developer.facebook.com
  a. We'd be very happy if you include "Friendika" in the application name
     to increase name recognition. The Friendika icons are also present
     in the images directory and may be uploaded as a Facebook app icon.
     Use images/friendika-16.jpg for the Icon and images/friendika-128.jpg for the Logo.
  b. The url should be your site URL with a trailing slash.
     You may use http://portal.friendika.com/privacy as the privacy policy
     URL unless your site has different requirements, and 
     http://portal.friendika.com as the Terms of Service URL unless
     you have different requirements. (Friendika is a software application
     and does not require Terms of Service, though your installation of it might).
  c. Set the following values in your .htconfig.php file
        $a->config['facebook']['appid'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxx';
        $a->config['facebook']['appsecret'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
     Replace with the settings Facebook gives you.
  d. Navigate to Set Web->Site URL & Domain -> Website Settings.  Set Site URL 
     to yoursubdomain.yourdomain.com.  Set Site Domain to your yourdomain.com.
2. Enable the facebook plugin by including it in .htconfig.php - e.g. 
    $a->config['system']['addon'] = 'plugin1,plugin2,facebook';
3. Visit the Facebook Settings section of the "Settings->Plugin Settings" page.
   and click 'Install Facebook Connector'.
4. This will ask you to login to Facebook and grant permission to the 
   plugin to do its stuff. Allow it to do so. 
5. You're done. To turn it off visit the Plugin Settings page again and
   'Remove Facebook posting'.

Vidoes and embeds will not be posted if there is no other content. Links 
and images will be converted to a format suitable for the Facebook API and 
long posts truncated - with a link to view the full post. 

Facebook contacts will not be able to view private photos, as they are not able to
authenticate to your site to establish identity. We will address this 
in a future release.
